What's new for you, release by release.

## v0.2.1 — 2026-08-14

> A hardening release: `assess` can no longer overwrite your design-system file by accident, a single bad row in a hand-edited spec can't crash an assessment, and usage detection stopped flagging tokens that are actually in use. Everything about this release is aimed at making assessments safe to run and safe to trust.

### 📈 Improved
- Assessments run noticeably faster — your files are scanned once instead of four times, with identical results.
- When a write is refused or fails, the message now tells you the actual reason in plain terms, instead of reciting the general permission rules or exposing internal details.
- The built-in help for `assess update` now matches what the command really does: it accepts only the flagged errors, and it mentions the JSON output and drift score.
- Various under-the-hood improvements to test coverage and release hygiene.

### 🐛 Fixed
- Running `assess --json` against your design-system file no longer overwrites that file with the assessment of it — your source of truth is protected.
- One unreadable row in a hand-edited spec table no longer takes the whole assessment down. The bad row is skipped, and the report tells you exactly which one and why.
- Tokens used only through CSS `var(...)` references are no longer falsely reported as unused.
- A token no longer counts as "used" just because a longer token with a similar name exists.
- A failed backup now stops cleanly with a clear message and a proper exit code, instead of crashing mid-run.
